# What is the MongoDB shell?

- The MongoDB Shell (called mongosh) is an interactive JavaScript-based command-line interface used to interact with MongoDB databases. 
- 
## It allows developers and administrators to:

- Connect to a MongoDB server

- Run queries

- Insert, update, or delete documents

- Perform administrative tasks like creating indexes or managing users

- It replaces the older mongo shell, offering more modern features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and improved error handling.
