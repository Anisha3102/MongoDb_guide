# What is an aggregation pipeline? Give an example use case.

### What is an Aggregation Pipeline?

- An **aggregation pipeline** in MongoDB is a framework for **processing data records and transforming them into aggregated results**. 
- It consists of **stages** that process documents in a **sequence**, where the output of one stage becomes the input for the next. 
- Common stages include `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`, `$limit`, and `$lookup`.

### Example Use Case: **E-commerce Sales Report**

**Scenario**: You have an `orders` collection and want to find the total sales per product category in the last 30 days.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      orderDate: { $gte: new Date(new Date() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$category",
      totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" },
      totalOrders: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: { totalSales: -1 }
  }
])
```
### What This Does:
$match: Filters orders from the last 30 days.

$group: Groups by product category, summing up amount and counting total orders.

$sort: Sorts categories by highest totalSales.
