# What is the difference between embedded documents and references in MongoDB?

| Feature                  | Embedded Documents                              | References                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Definition               | Storing related data within the same document   | Storing related data in a separate document and linking via an ID |
| Data Location            | Single document                                 | Multiple documents across collections           |
| Query Performance        | Faster for read operations                      | Requires joins/lookups, so slower reads         |
| Data Duplication         | No duplication (self-contained)                 | Minimal duplication; normalized data            |
| Consistency              | Easier to maintain consistency                  | Requires manual consistency checks              |
| Flexibility              | Less flexible; large documents can be problematic| More flexible; documents can evolve separately  |
| Use Case                 | One-to-few relationships (e.g., comments in a post) | One-to-many or many-to-many (e.g., users and orders) |
| Atomicity                | Operations are atomic within a single document  | No cross-document atomicity (unless using transactions) |
