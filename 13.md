## What is Mongoose?
- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a structured, schema-based solution to model application data in MongoDB.

## Why is Mongoose Used with MongoDB?

| Feature              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schema Definition    | Allows you to define clear data models with validation rules and types      |
| Data Validation      | Automatically checks and enforces correct data before saving to MongoDB     |
| Middleware (Hooks)   | Lets you run logic before/after saving, updating, or deleting documents      |
| Query Helpers        | Provides powerful query-building and chaining with a fluent API              |
| Relationships        | Supports population (references between models using `.populate()`)         |
| Cleaner Code         | Abstracts complex MongoDB operations into reusable models and methods        |


## Example:
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  age: Number
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create a new user
const newUser = new User({ name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com', age: 25 });
newUser.save();
```

## Benefits of Mongoose:
- Enforces structure in schema-less MongoDB

- Simplifies CRUD operations

- Reduces code redundancy

- Ideal for full-stack applications using Node.js
