# What is MongoDB? How is it different from SQL databases?

- MongoDB is a NoSQL, open-source, document-oriented database used for storing large volumes of data in a flexible, scalable, and high-performance manner. 
- It stores data in JSON-like documents (specifically BSON ‚Äî Binary JSON), which allows for dynamic schemas, meaning we don't have to predefine the structure of your data like in traditional SQL databases.

| **Feature**              | **MongoDB (NoSQL)**                             | **SQL Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Format**          | JSON-like documents (BSON)                      | Tables with rows and columns                          |
| **Schema**               | Schema-less (flexible)                          | Fixed schema (predefined structure)                   |
| **Scalability**          | Horizontal scaling (via sharding)              | Vertical scaling (usually via more powerful hardware) |
| **Joins**                | Limited join support                            | Full JOIN operations supported                        |
| **Transactions**         | Multi-document transactions supported (from v4.0+) | Fully ACID-compliant transactions                    |
| **Query Language**       | MongoDB Query Language (MQL)                    | Structured Query Language (SQL)                       |
| **Use Case Suitability** | Unstructured or semi-structured data            | Structured data with relationships                    |
| **Speed & Flexibility**  | Fast for high-volume, read/write operations     | Good for complex queries and analytics                |


## When to Use MongoDB
- When data structure is dynamic or evolving

- For high-speed, large-scale apps (e.g., IoT, real-time analytics)

- When working with JSON-like objects directly (e.g., in JavaScript/Node.js apps)

## When to Use SQL Databases
- When data is highly structured and relationships are important

- For complex queries involving JOINs and ACID-compliant transactions

- Applications like banking, ERP, and traditional business systems
