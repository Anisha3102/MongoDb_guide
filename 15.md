# What are middleware hooks in Mongoose?

- Middleware hooks in Mongoose are functions that run before or after certain lifecycle events in a Mongoose model, such as saving, updating, or deleting documents. 
- They allow us to inject custom logic during these operations.

## Types of Middleware Hooks

| Hook Type | Description                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pre()`   | Runs before a specific operation (e.g., before saving a document) |
| `post()`  | Runs after a specific operation (e.g., after removing a document) |


## Common Lifecycle Events:
- save

- validate

- remove

- updateOne

- deleteOne

- find, findOne, etc.

## Example:
```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String
});

// Pre-save hook (runs before saving a document)
userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  console.log('About to save user:', this.name);
  next(); // Proceed to save
});

// Post-remove hook (runs after removing a document)
userSchema.post('remove', function(doc) {
  console.log('Removed user:', doc.name);
});
```
- These hooks are useful for tasks like hashing passwords, logging, data validation, or triggering external actions.
