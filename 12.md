# How do you design schema relationships in MongoDB?

### Designing schema relationships in MongoDB depends on how your application accesses and manipulates data. MongoDB supports two main types of relationships:

## 1. Embedded Documents (Denormalization)
#### When to Use:
- "One-to-few" or tightly coupled data

- Data is always accessed together

### Advantages:
- Fewer reads (faster)

- Atomic updates

### Disadvantages:
- Document size limit (16MB)

- Updates require writing the whole document

### Example:
```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": [
    { "id": 101, "item": "Pen", "qty": 2 },
    { "id": 102, "item": "Notebook", "qty": 1 }
  ]
}
```
## 2. References (Normalization)
#### When to Use:
- "One-to-many" or "many-to-many"

- Large or frequently accessed independently

### Advantages:
- Modular and scalable

- Better for unrelated or large subdocuments

### Disadvantages:
- Requires manual joins using $lookup

- Slightly slower reads

### Example:
#### Users Collection:

```json
{ "_id": 1, "name": "Alice" }
```
#### Orders Collection:

```json
{ "_id": 101, "user_id": 1, "item": "Pen", "qty": 2 }
```
