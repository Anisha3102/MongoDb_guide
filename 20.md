### What Are Transactions in MongoDB?

A **transaction** in MongoDB is a sequence of one or more operations (like `insert`, `update`, `delete`) that are **executed together as a single unit of work**. Either **all operations succeed** or **none are applied**, ensuring **atomicity** and **data consistency**.

### âœ… Key Features:
- **Multi-document** and **multi-collection** support (since MongoDB 4.0+).
- Ensures **ACID** properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- Supports **read and write operations** within a single session.

### ðŸŸ¢ When Would You Use Transactions?

We should use transactions when you need to **maintain data integrity across multiple documents or collections**. Common use cases include:

1. **Banking Systems**  
   Transferring money between accounts (debit from one, credit to another).

2. **E-commerce Orders**  
   Placing an order: update product stock, create order, and deduct user balance â€” all in one transaction.

3. **Inventory Management**  
   Multiple updates across product and warehouse collections.

4. **Relational-Like Operations**  
   When enforcing relational behavior that requires multiple related writes.

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```js
const session = await db.startSession();
session.startTransaction();

try {
  await db.accounts.updateOne(
    { _id: "A" },
    { $inc: { balance: -100 } },
    { session }
  );

  await db.accounts.updateOne(
    { _id: "B" },
    { $inc: { balance: 100 } },
    { session }
  );

  await session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  await session.abortTransaction();
} finally {
  session.endSession();
}
```
