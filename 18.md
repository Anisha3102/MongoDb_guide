### How Do You Perform Pagination in MongoDB?

- Pagination in MongoDB is typically done using the `.skip()` and `.limit()` methods in queries. These allow you to retrieve a specific subset of documents â€” useful for displaying data in pages.

### Syntax:

```js
db.collection.find().skip(pageNumber * pageSize).limit(pageSize)
```

### Example:
If we want to display page 2 with 5 items per page:

```js
db.products.find().skip(5).limit(5)
```
- skip(5) skips the first 5 documents (i.e., page 1).

- limit(5) returns the next 5 documents (i.e., page 2).

### Notes:
.skip() becomes inefficient on large datasets, especially with high page numbers.

For better performance, consider range-based pagination using a field like _id or createdAt as a cursor.

### Range-Based Example:
```js
db.products.find({ _id: { $gt: lastSeenId } }).limit(5)
```
This fetches the next 5 items after a known _id, improving performance over .skip() in large collections.
