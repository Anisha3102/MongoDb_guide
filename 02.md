# What are collections and documents in MongoDB?

## Document
- A document is a single record in MongoDB, similar to a row in a relational database.

- It is stored in BSON format (Binary JSON), but you interact with it using JSON-like syntax.

## A document is a key-value pair structure that can include:

- Nested documents

- Arrays

- Data types like strings, numbers, booleans, dates, etc.

## Example of a document:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  "name": "Anisha",
  "age": 22,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
  "address": {
    "city": "Jaipur",
    "state": "Rajasthan"
  }
}
```
- The _id field is mandatory and uniquely identifies each document in a collection.

## Collection
- A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in SQL.

- Collections do not require a fixed schema â€” documents within a collection can have different fields and structures.

- All documents within a collection are usually related in some way.

## Example:
- A users collection might contain the above document, and others like:

```json
{
  "name": "Rahul",
  "email": "rahul@example.com"
}
```
